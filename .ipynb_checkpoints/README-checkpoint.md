<h1> LSTM </h1>
<h2>The What</h2>
<p>
    The LSTM is Long Short Term Memory architecture used for learning long term dependcies
    and overcome the risk of exploding and vanishing gradients of the vanilla recurrent
    neural networks.
</p>

<h2>The Need</h2>
<p>
    I am in the race with myself to learn all the key concepts and possible literally all
    the concepts a neural network contains both nn logic and the language requirement to 
    perform the concept.
